            Rivendell, also known as Imladris in Sindarin, was an Elven town and
            the house of Elrond, located in the Middle-earth. It is described as
            "The last Homely House East of the Sea" in reference to Valinor,
            which was west of the Great Sea in Aman.
          </p>
          <p>
            Located at the edge of a narrow gorge of the river Bruinen, but
            well-hidden in the moorlands and foothills of the Misty Mountains.
            One of the main approaches to Rivendell passed through the nearby
            Ford of Bruinen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rivendell was established by Elrond in the Second Age of
            Middle-earth. In the War of the Elves and Sauron, Elrond was sent
            from Lindon with a host of Elves to aid in resisting Sauron.
            However, he arrived too late, and was forced to retreat with the
            refugees, to a valley where they made their stronghold. This was the
            beginning of Rivendell.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last surviving son of Isildur, Valandir, was fostered by Elrond
            in Rivendell until ready to take up his throne eight years later.
            This began a precedent, as after the fall of Angmar, the heirs of
            Isildur were all fostered in Rivendell.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Quest of Erebor, Bilbo Baggins and the Company of Thorin
            Oakenshield stopped off at Rivendell. Bilbo described it as "a
            perfect house, whether you like food or sleep, or story-telling or
            singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of
            them all". Years later, Frodo Baggins and his Hobbit companions
            journeyed to Rivendell, where they met with Bilbo, who had retired
            there after his eleventy-first birthday. Several other Elves,
            Dwarves and Men also arrived at Rivendell on seperate errands. At
            the Council of Elrond they learned that the fates of all their kinds
            were related to that of the One Ring. Rivendell served as the
            starting point for the Quest of the Ring and birthplace of the
            Fellowship of the Ring.
