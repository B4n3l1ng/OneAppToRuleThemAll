  <div class="about">
    <p>
      The Shire was a realm in northwestern Middle-earth, inhabited by the
      hobbits. It was located in the region of Eriador.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the late Third Age it was one of the few heavily-populates areas left
      in Eriador. Contrary to popular misconception, The Shirew was not the
      birthplace of Frodo Baggins, as he was born in Buckland, which at the time
      was not formally a part of the Shire, despite being colonized by Shire
      hobbits.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the Third Age, Saruman tried to take control of the Shire
      for a very short period, but was killed in the Battle of Bywater, which
      ended the War of the Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shire was bounded by the Brandywine River to the East, although
      Buckland (which was later made part of the Shire after the War of the
      Ring) was further east after crossing the River. The cilmate of the Shire
      was very similar to that of England: cool, but with not overly cold
      winters, and fairly warm smmers. Rainfall was fairly frequent, with snow
      being much more rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      On J.R.R. Tolkien's maps, the Shire was located at about the same position
      as England was on modern European maps, solidifying another link bettween
      the real world and Tolkien's universe. Throughout the narrative, Tolkie
      also implies numerous points of similarity betwen the two, such as
      weather, agriculture and dialect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shire's history was mostly peaceful, with the most dangerous time
      period stemming from Bilbo Baggins' acquisition of the One Ring. The Shire
      was first visited by the nine Ringwraiths, after which it was enslaved by
      Saruman. It was later liberated with the help of Frodo, Sam, Merry and
      Pippin after the end of the Quest of the Ring. After Aragorn's return as
      the King of Arnor and Gondor, the Shire became a protected enclave inside
      the Reunited Kingdom.
