          <h3>Biography:</h3>
          <p>
            Samwise Gamgee, known as Sam, was a hobbit of the Shire. He was
            Frodo Baggins' gardener and best friend. Sam proved himself to be
            Frodo's closest and most dependable companion, the most loyal of the
            Fellowship of the Ring, and played a critical role in protecting
            Frodo and destroying the One Ring.
          </p>
          <h3>Titles:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bearer of the One Ring (for 2 days)</li>
            <li>Mayor of the Shire</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Quotes:</h3>
          <p>
            "But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even
            darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it
            will shine out the clearer." To Frodo, when he was losing hope,
            thinking the darkness would consume him before he could fulfill his
            mission of destroying the ring.
          </p>
          <p>
            "One tiny Hobbit against all the evil the world could muster."
            Speaking of Frodo and their journey to Mount Doom.
          </p>
          <p>
            "If I take one more step, it will be the furthest away from home
            I've ever been." To Frodo, as they are first leaving The Shire on
            the start of their journey.
