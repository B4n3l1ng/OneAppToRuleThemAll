    <h3>Biography:</h3>
    <p>
      Sauron, the epopymous Lord of the Rings, maker of the One Ring, the most
      trusted lieutenent of Morgoth. After Morgoth's ousting by the Valar,
      Sauron became the second Dark Lord, and sought to conquer Middle-earth and
      even NÃºmenor through guileful trickery - the chief representation of which
      were the Rings of Power. At the End of the Second Age, sauron was defeated
      in the War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men united under Gil-galad
      and Elendir. In the final battle, Isildur managed to cut the One Ring from
      him, dismantling Sauron's corporeal form and ridding him of much of his
      power. After centuries lying dormant, rebuilding strength and stirring
      awake evil things, Sauron returned to power late in the Third Age, but was
      permanently crippled in the War of the Ring, after the destruction of his
      Ring in the fire of Mouth Doom, by Frodo Baggins, and his spirit was
      claimed by the Void.
