  <div class="about">
    <p>
      Mount Doom, also known as Orodruin and Amon Amarth, was a volcano in
      Mordor where the One Ring was forged, and the only place it could be
      destroyed. It was the ultimate destination for Frodo Baggins and Samwise
      Gamgee in the Quest of the Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mount Doom was created by the first dark lord Melkor during the First
      Age. During the Second Age, Sauron chose the land of Mordor as his
      dwelling-place. He used the fire that welled there from the heart of the
      earth in his sorceries and his forging. Sauron forged the One Ring in the
      depths of the Cracks of Doom, which was built within Mount Doom itself.
      Mount Doom erupted, signaling Sauron's attack on Gondor, where it earned
      its name "Amon Amarth."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the War of the Last Alliance and Sauron's disappearance, it was
      dormant and only sprung into life after Sauron's return to Mordor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frodo and Sam trekked up the slopes of Mount Doom and entered Sammath
      Naur, on their quest to destroy the One Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the destruction of the Ring, Mount Doom erupted with great force,
      sending massive lava floes down its sides and scattering the area with
      volcanic debris. The cone of the volcano was ripped apart by the eruption,
      and the Nazg√ªl and their mounts were destroyed in the ejection of lava as
      they tried to reach Frodo to reclaim the Ring.
