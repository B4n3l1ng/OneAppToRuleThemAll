    <h3>Biography:</h3>
    <p>
      Legolas was a Sindar Elf who was part of the Fellowship of the Ring in the
      Third Age. Son of the Elven King Thranduil of Mirkwood, Legolas was the
      Prince of Mirkwood, a messenger, and a master archer. With his keen
      eyesith, sensitive hearing, and excellent bowmanship, Legolas was valuable
      to the Fellowship in their hourney across Middle-earth. He was well-known
      for becoming friends with the Dwarf Gimli, despite their long-held
      differences.
