          <h3>Biography:</h3>
          <p>
            Gandalf the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally
            named Ol√≥rin, was a Wizard (Istar), dispatched to Middle-earth in
            the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin
            Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from
            Smaug, and helped form the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One
            Ring. He later led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War
            of the Ring.
