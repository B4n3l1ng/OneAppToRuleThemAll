    <h3>Biography:</h3>
    <p>
      Saruman, also known as Saruman the White, was the frist of the order of
      Istari (Wizards), who came to Middle-earth as emissaries of the Valar in
      the Third Age. He was the Wizards' leader, and chief of the White Council
      that opposed Sauron. His extensive studies of dark magic, however,
      eventually led him to desire the One Ring and lust for power. Thinking he
      could gain it for himself or become Sauron's servant alone. Saruman allied
      Isengard with Mordor in the War of the Ring, in which he was defeated.

      Serves as a monumental foreshadowing to the dangers to come.

      "The hour is later than you think." To Gandalf, telling him it's much too
      late to stop Sauron, and that he has choosen to ally himself with the dark
      lord.

    <p>
      "Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard... and
      Mordor?" To no one, as he finally unveils his agreement with Sauron,
      allying his own forces of Isengard, with the dark lord's in Mordor.
